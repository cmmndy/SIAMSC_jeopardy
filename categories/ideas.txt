        C++: "W8012: Comparing signed and unsigned values"
          Since the ranges of signed and unsigned types are different the result of an ordered comparison of an unsigned and a signed value might have an unexpected result.
          Example:
          #pragma warn +csu
          boolfoo(unsigned u, int i)
          {
          return u < i;
          }
        -> C++: W8019: "Code has no effect"
            This warning is issued when the compiler encounters a statement with some operators that have no effect.
              For example, the statement
              a + b;
              has no effect on either variable.
        - What is the compiler flag for ... (e.g. suppress warnings, treat warnings as errors, debugging...)
